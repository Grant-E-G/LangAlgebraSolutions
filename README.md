This repository contains solutions to Lang's Algebra Textbook 3rd Edition. Answers are written in Latex using the subfile package to construct the full file. This is not intended to be a complete solution set. These solutions are not provided with any guaranty of accuracy, clarity, or simplicity. Please report errors as issues. 

The goal is to linearly increase the percent of solutions per chapter from 30% to 40% rounded up. The assigned problems should be randomly chosen as follows. Problems should be divided evenly among subsections with extras backfilled, and in each subsection, problems should be distributed in a scaled beta distribution with values (4.5,2.5).
